# Dashboard Framework Improvement Tasks

This document contains a detailed checklist of actionable improvement tasks for the dashboard framework. These tasks are logically ordered and cover both architectural and code-level improvements.

## Type Safety and Code Quality

[x] 1. Replace `any` types with proper interfaces or types throughout the codebase
   - Focus on dashboard-container.component.ts
   - Replace any types in widget-builder.ts
   - Improve typing in echart.component.ts

[x] 2. Remove `@ts-ignore` comments and fix the underlying issues
   - Fix type casting in echart.component.ts

[x] 3. Add proper error handling to async methods
   - Add try/catch blocks to onDataLoad method in dashboard-container.component.ts
   - Implement error states for widgets

[x] 4. Implement proper null checking throughout the codebase
   - Add null checks before accessing properties
   - Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing operators

[x] 5. Add comprehensive unit tests for all components
   - Increase test coverage for dashboard-container.component
   - Add tests for widget components

## Performance Optimization

[x] 6. Optimize widget data loading
   - Implement caching for widget data
   - Only reload affected widgets when filters change, not all widgets

[x] 7. Implement lazy loading for widget components
   - Use Angular's lazy loading to only load widget types that are actually used

[x] 8. Optimize ECharts rendering
   - Implement proper resize handling
   - Use ECharts' dataset API for better performance

[x] 9. Reduce unnecessary re-renders
   - Implement OnPush change detection strategy
   - Use trackBy functions for ngFor loops

[x] 10. Implement virtual scrolling for large dashboards
    - Use Angular CDK's virtual scroll for better performance with many widgets

## Architecture Improvements

[x] 11. Extract complex calculations into separate services
    - Move chart height, map center, and zoom calculations to a dedicated service
    - Create a FilterService to handle filter logic

[x] 12. Implement a state management solution
    - Consider using NgRx or a simpler state management library
    - Separate state from UI components

[x] 13. Create a proper widget plugin system
    - Define a clear interface for widget plugins
    - Make it easier to add new widget types

[x] 14. Improve the event system
    - Replace direct EventEmitter usage with a more decoupled approach
    - Implement a proper event bus

[x] 15. Extract common widget functionality into base classes or mixins
    - Create a BaseWidgetComponent with common functionality
    - Use inheritance or composition to share code between widget types

## User Experience Improvements

[x] 16. Add loading states for widgets
    - Show loading indicators when data is being fetched
    - Add error states for failed data loading

[x] 17. Improve widget configuration UI
    - Create a more user-friendly widget configuration interface
    - Add validation for widget configuration

[x] 18. Implement undo/redo functionality for dashboard editing
    - Keep track of dashboard state changes
    - Allow users to undo/redo changes

[x] 19. Add accessibility features
    - Ensure all components are keyboard navigable
    - Add proper ARIA attributes
    - Implement high contrast mode

[ ] 20. Improve mobile responsiveness
    - Ensure dashboard works well on mobile devices
    - Implement mobile-specific layouts

## Code Modernization

[ ] 21. Update ECharts import method
    - Replace require with modern ES module imports
    - Use dynamic imports properly

[ ] 22. Implement proper Angular dependency injection
    - Use providedIn: 'root' for services
    - Use proper injection tokens

[ ] 23. Update to latest Angular features
    - Use standalone components consistently
    - Implement signals for state management
    - Use functional guards and resolvers

[ ] 24. Improve build configuration
    - Optimize bundle size
    - Implement proper tree-shaking

[ ] 25. Add proper documentation
    - Add JSDoc comments to all public methods and properties
    - Create comprehensive documentation for the library

## New Features

[ ] 26. Add more widget types
    - Implement a heatmap widget
    - Add a gauge chart widget
    - Create a data grid widget with sorting and filtering

[ ] 27. Implement dashboard templates
    - Allow users to save and load dashboard templates
    - Provide pre-built templates for common use cases

[ ] 28. Add export functionality
    - Allow exporting dashboards as images or PDFs
    - Implement data export to CSV or Excel

[ ] 29. Implement real-time data updates
    - Add WebSocket support for real-time data
    - Implement polling for data sources that don't support WebSockets

[ ] 30. Add dashboard sharing and collaboration features
    - Implement user permissions for dashboards
    - Add commenting and annotation features
