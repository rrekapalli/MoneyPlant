# Filter Highlighting - Behavior Correction Summary

## Issue Identified
The initial implementation had a critical flaw where filter highlighting wasn't working because:

1. **Root Cause**: When a filter was applied, the `applyFiltersToDashboardData()` method was filtering the entire dashboard data to only include matching rows
2. **Result**: Source widgets only received filtered data (e.g., only "Real Estate" data), leaving no other elements to grey out
3. **User Experience**: Clicking on charts showed no highlighting effect - just traditional filtering

## Solution Implemented

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Smart Dataset Management
```typescript
// In applyFiltersToDashboardData()
if (highlightingEnabled) {
  // Keep full dataset available for source widgets
  this.dashboardData = [...INITIAL_DASHBOARD_DATA];
} else {
  // Traditional filtering for compatibility
  this.dashboardData = this.applyFiltersToFlatData(INITIAL_DASHBOARD_DATA, filters);
}
```

#### 2. Dual Data Retrieval Strategy
- **Source Widgets**: Get full dataset for highlighting (show all elements, highlight selected, grey others)
- **Non-Source Widgets**: Get filtered dataset for traditional filtering (show only matching data)

```typescript
if (highlightingEnabled && !isSourceWidget && filters.length > 0) {
  // Non-source widgets: filtered data from original dataset
  baseData = this.getFilteredDataForWidgetFromOriginalData(widgetTitle, filters);
} else {
  // Source widgets: full data for highlighting
  baseData = this.getFilteredDataForWidget(widgetTitle);
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced Source Widget Detection
```typescript
const isSourceWidget = filters.some(filter => {
  const widgetIdMatch = filter['widgetId'] === widget.id;
  const widgetTitleMatch = filter['widgetTitle'] === widgetTitle;
  return widgetIdMatch || widgetTitleMatch;
});
```

## Final Behavior

### When User Clicks Chart Element:

#### Source Widget (where click occurred):
- ✅ Shows **ALL data elements** (e.g., all 5 pie slices: Stocks, Bonds, Cash, Real Estate, Commodities)
- ✅ **Clicked element highlighted** with colored border and full opacity
- ✅ **Other elements greyed out** with reduced opacity (25% by default)
- ✅ **No data loss** - everything remains visible with visual emphasis

#### Other Widgets:
- ✅ Show **only matching data** using traditional filtering
- ✅ Clean, focused results based on the filter criteria
- ✅ Empty state handling when no data matches

### Configuration Options:
- Toggle highlighting mode on/off
- Adjustable opacity levels (subtle 40%, medium 25%, strong 10%)
- Customizable highlight and filter colors
- Dashboard-level and widget-level control

## Technical Implementation Details

- **Chart Type Detection**: Automatic detection (pie, bar, line, scatter)
- **Filter Matching**: Smart comparison for pie slices and bar chart elements  
- **Performance**: Efficient dual-path data processing
- **Compatibility**: Falls back to traditional filtering when highlighting is disabled

## Files Modified
- `overall.component.ts`: Core filtering and highlighting logic
- `filter.service.ts`: Chart-specific highlighting methods
- Dashboard configuration: Highlighting enablement and styling options

This implementation provides the expected user experience where source widgets show contextual highlighting while other widgets provide clean filtered results.
